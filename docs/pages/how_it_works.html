<h1>How it Works</h1>
<p>We help agencies from startups to enterprise easily and rapidly launch websites and centralize their web presence. Our focus is delivering creative content management, rich media and beautiful user experience on solid, secure, and scalable systems. As a vertically integrated development and delivery solution we offer a unique opportunity to streamline your project and capabilities as well as communicate your company vision through an immersive user experience. Jeremy Michael Cerda is our project manager and lead architect. Jeremy is a full stack web developer and enterprise web architect with over 14 years of experience in web and application development, creative content production, user experience, user research and content strategy as well as search engine optimization, web and campaign tracking, statistics and analytics. You will be given direct 24 hour contact access and support from a member of the team for the term of the agreement once one has been made. We begin by setting up an initial technical meeting and following that up with scheduled bi-weekly meetings between our team and yours. We generally prefer to schedule these meeting on Monday and Thursday, however we are flexible. Additional meetings are ongoing and will be scheduled on an as needed basis. The Plan Project Evaluation Successful projects begin with carefully laid plans. We create that plan during our “Project Evaluation” process, which each project goes through before any work begins. Research During the research process, our goal is to get to the heart of your project and gain as much of your organization’s perspective as possible. We spend time with you, asking questions and listening. As our research turns up problems or solutions, we run them by you and gather feedback. We also use this time to learn what third party applications and business systems you currently use and discuss integration with your new web presence. Recommendations As the evaluation process moves forward, we will present you with our technical recommendations. Depending on the nature of the project, those recommendations may be regarding specific technology, content organization, marketing strategies, or even business processes. Our recommendations are always driven by the context and goals of the project and, wherever appropriate, we will present you with options along with the recommended choice. Development Scope With the recommendations complete and a clear consensus on direction, we move forward and prepare a development scope. The scope is carefully and thoroughly detailed. In the case of a website redesign, each page of the site is outlined, along with all the primary elements and their functionality. In the case of an application, the programming logic is detailed and the interfaces are outlined and wireframed. Timeline &amp; Estimate At the conclusion of the evaluation, we will determine a timeline and final budget estimate for our team to implement the recommendations. The estimate is firm and nearly always falls within the ballpark we offer at the onset of the evaluation. That being said, we are an agile organization and additional feature requests could augment project estimates.</p>
